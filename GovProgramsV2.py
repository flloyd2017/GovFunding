    Itâ€™s easy to call for increased government funding or criticize program cuts, but have you ever considered how much these programs actually cost you?

    Below is a breakdown of various government programs and their cost per citizen per year. Given that these expenses are covered by taxpayers, what programs would you choose to fund, and how much would you personally be willing to contribute?

    At the end, weâ€™ll collect the data to see which programs citizens value the most.
